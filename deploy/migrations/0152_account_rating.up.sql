-- Server-local composite account rating for gramsrv clients and moderation /
-- operations. This uses gramsrv's own policy rather than claiming to reproduce
-- Telegram's private rating algorithm.
--
-- account_rating is a derived read model: it can always be rebuilt from the
-- contributing sources (stars_transactions, message counts, moderation state)
-- plus the manual adjustments recorded in account_rating_events. Every stored
-- component is kept separately so the admin panel can show why a level was
-- reached, and so recomputing one signal never silently discards another.
--
-- 'stars' is the composite score used by the local gramsrv model, not a wallet
-- balance.
