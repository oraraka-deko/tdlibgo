// The bid form id is the only thing standing between two bids of the same amount by
// the same bidder for the same recipient. Once the first bid's round is settled its
// payment receipt stays in star_gift_auction_bid_payments forever, so a repeated id
// makes BidStarGiftAuction answer the next bid from that receipt — reported as paid,
// never active. Binding the bidder's own bid generation is what keeps the ids apart.
